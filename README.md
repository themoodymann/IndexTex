# IndexTex
Automatically index your latex project. Put all your .tex files into an input directory, run the Python program, and collect all your indexed .tex files in the output directory. The current version indexes Definitions, Theorems, Captions, and all emphasized words. This selection can easily be changed by updating the search strings at the top of the program. After that, a manual parse of the output .tex files is probably needed, as you might want to remove or change some indexes.
Have fun!
